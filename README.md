# jenome

*"DNA is source code for the most complex machine in the universe."*
--Randall Munroe, "What If?"

Code for playing around with genome data, human or otherwise.

**See my blog posts** at
  [johnj.com](http://johnj.com/exploratory-genomics-with-clojure.html)
  for many more details.

### Testing

    lein spec # add `-a` to automatically retest after updating code.

### Process a .2bit genome file (convert to FASTA-like plain text in stdout):

First, download some `.2bit` genome code from e.g.
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html. Or, use
`resources/sacCer3.2bit`.

Then,

    lein run <filename.2bit>

See also the commented-out example expressions in `src/jenome/examples.clj`.
